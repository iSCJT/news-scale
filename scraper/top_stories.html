She has promised to deliver billions of pounds in tax cuts in an emergency Budget if she wins power. \nFormer chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he would cut VAT on energy bills for a year, but permanent tax cuts should wait until inflation goes down.\nWith the cap on domestic energy prices set to soar in the autumn, what to do about rising living costs has dominated the contest in recent weeks.\nBoth candidates have come under pressure to spell out how they would protect households from the rises, as well give help to businesses, which are not covered by the price cap.\nMr Johnson left big spending decisions to his successor after his resignation in July, leading opposition parties to accuse the government of paralysis.\nMs Truss has said she would reverse April's rise to National Insurance and cut green levies on energy bills to help households with costs. She has signalled she would provide more support on top of this, but has offered no details. \nMr Sunak has said he would make further payments to pensioners and the low paid over winter, on top of the payments they are already due to receive.\nThe contest began in mid-July, when Mr Johnson was forced out by a ministerial revolt over a string of scandals.\nThe original field of 11 contenders was whittled down to two in a series of Tory MP ballots, with the final two going into a run-off to be decided by the membership, which stands at around 160,000.\nAlthough Mr Sunak had the most support among Tory MPs, opinion polls have suggested Ms Truss enjoys more support among party members.\nIn a break with tradition, the winner will travel to Balmoral Castle in Scotland to be appointed by the Queen, rather than Buckingham Palace.\nShe has been suffering from mobility issues and it is understood the change was made to prevent the need for any last-minute rearrangements.", 'sentiment-title': 0.9757547974586487, 'sentiment-summary': -0.9962059259414673, 'sentiment-article-title': -0.6258998513221741, 'sentiment-text': -0.10203736027081807, 'emotion-title': {'anger': 0.9825740456581116, 'joy': 0.007293577305972576, 'fear': 0.004851361270993948, 'sadness': 0.0032567933667451143, 'love': 0.001361615490168333, 'surprise': 0.0006626402609981596}, 'emotion-summary': {'joy': 0.9867558479309082, 'anger': 0.0057843648828566074, 'sadness': 0.002374565228819847, 'fear': 0.0022876274306327105, 'love': 0.00203528581187129, 'surprise': 0.0007622632547281682}, 'emotion-article-title': {'anger': 0.9622718691825867, 'joy': 0.017089109867811203, 'fear': 0.009331680834293365, 'sadness': 0.008464657701551914, 'love': 0.0018731324234977365, 'surprise': 0.000969580898527056}, 'emotion-text': {'anger': 0.48798435734998846, 'joy': 0.3736451295537538, 'fear': 0.03572993878171676, 'sadness': 0.0951765402763461, 'love': 0.005216233371659958, 'surprise': 0.0022477841080722604}}, {'section': 'top-stories', 'position': 2, 'title': 'Sadiq Khan wrongly ousted Cressida Dick -

least of all one so senior and long-serving - to be given under an hour to decide whether to resign or to challenge the mayor\'s position was entirely unacceptable."\nHe described the timetable "imposed" on the commissioner as "wholly arbitrary", adding there had been "no explanation why the commissioner\'s position had to be publicly resolved in such a short space of time", giving her little time to consult with others.\n"The mayor was entirely incapable in interview of explaining why he believed he had to make a public statement on the commissioner\'s position on the evening of the 10 February, 2022."\nThis video can not be played\nWatch London Mayor Sadiq Khan\'s statement on Cressida Dick\'s resignation\nSir Tom said in his opinion the Mayor and MOPAC\'s actions were "oppressive" and "unreasonable".\n"The pressure to resign was considerable, and it succeeded," he added.\nIn June - months after Dame Cressida quit - the Met was placed into an advanced stage of monitoring, in what the home secretary described as "special measures".\nMs Patel said it was clear to her the Met Police was falling short in getting "the basics right".\nBy Daniel Sandford, home affairs correspondent\nOn the face of it the criticisms of London\'s mayor Sadiq Khan in this review are devastating.\nSir Tom Winsor says the mayor had effectively "constructively dismissed" the most senior police officer in the UK.\nHe wrote that his staff had been "unjustifiably politically brutal", that they had imposed a "wholly arbitrary" timetable, and there could be "no justification" for the mayor\'s "unfair" conduct or his "oppressive and unreasonable treatment" of Dame Cressida Dick.\nSadiq Khan has sought to undermine the review\'s damage to him by claiming Sir Tom has a history of supporting Conservative Party politicians and policies and is "clearly biased"\nIt is worth remembering that the reputation of Dame Cressida and the force she was leading were at a very low point in February.\nBut what is at stake here is whether it should be possible for a politician - either in a fit of pique or for entirely justifiable reasons - to just get rid of a police chief by threatening to publicly undermine them. \nSir Tom has clearly concluded that parliament has put procedures in place and these should be followed. He says that politicians should have to pay a high political price for circumventing that process as happened on 10 February.\nResponding to Sir Tom\'s report Mr Khan said: "On the former commissioner\'s watch, trust in the police fell to record lows following a litany of terrible scandals. \n"What happened was simple - I lost confidence in the former commissioner\'s ability to make the changes needed and she then chose to stand aside.\n"Londoners elected me to hold the Met commissioner to account and that\'s exactly what I have done. \n"I make absolutely no apology for demanding better for London and for putting the interests of the city I love first. I will continue working with the new commissioner to reduce crime and to rebuild trust and confidence in the police." \nThe circumstances of Dame Cressida\'s departure were similar to one of her predecessors Sir Ian Blair - who resigned as Met commissioner in 2008 when the then mayor, Boris Johnson, said he had lost confidence in his leadership.\nIn a statement Dame Cressida said: "I regret this report was necessary but I hope it will help create a sounder foundation for my successors.\n"At all times I sought to uphold the law and act ethically and with goodwill, professionalism, openness and trust.\n"I fully respect the need for democratic oversight of policing. It is also important that politicians respect due process and do not break the rules.\n"I hope this report is an opportunity for others to reflect on how City Hall functions and is held to account."\nIn a statement the Home Office defended Sir Tom\'s findings.\nA spokeswoman said: "He has never been afraid to speak truth to power and he upholds the highest standards of integrity when it comes to reporting the facts.\n"He was hired to deliver a report on the facts surrounding the departure of the commissioner and he has done just that."\nFollow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

It also said the appointment could delay its investigation as the special master would likely need to obtain security clearance as well as authorisation from the intelligence agencies to view the materials.\nAt a hearing on Thursday, Judge Cannon indicated that she may grant Mr Trump\'s request.', 'sentiment-title': -0.9952349066734314, 'sentiment-summary': -0.999492883682251,

a gunman\'s weapon jammed as he aimed at her.\nFootage shows the moment Cristina Fernández de Kirchner found herself face-to-face with the loaded weapon.\nThe former president was outside her home, surrounded by a mob of supporters who back her in her fight against corruption charges.\nPolice said the gunman, identified as a 35-year-old Brazilian man, had been taken into custody. \nThey are attempting to establish a motive for the attack on the left-leaning politician, who was Argentina\'s president from 2007 to 2015, and its first lady for four years before that.\nPresident Alberto Fernández revealed the gun was loaded with five bullets, but failed to fire when triggered. \nVideo circulating on social media shows the gun emerging from the crowd as Ms Fernández de Kirchner approaches. She initially appears confused by what is going on, ducking down to retrieve an object dropped on the floor.\nIn another video, people in the crowd appear to try to block Ms Fernández de Kirchner from the suspected gunman, who came within inches of her. \nThe crowd has been gathering outside her home for the last few nights in a show of support as she fights charges of defrauding the state and being involved in a scheme to divert public funds while she was president.\nA police spokesperson earlier told Reuters news agency that a weapon was found a few metres from the scene after the man had been arrested.\nPolice named the suspect as Fernando Andrés Sabag Montiel, Brazilian-born but with an Argentine mother, who has lived in Argentina since he came to the country as a child in 1993. He had previously been arrested in 2021 while carrying a 35cm knife.\nPictures of him taken from his social media posts and published on Argentine newspaper websites depicted him with tattoos associated with neo-Nazi groups.\nAfter searching his apartment, police seized two boxes containing 100 bullets, according to investigators quoted by La Nación newspaper.\nLa Nación also reported that Pope Francis had telephoned Ms Fernández de Kirchner and had a "brief and cordial" conversation with her.\nThe Argentine-born Pope, who has received the vice-president several times at the Vatican, also sent her a telegram in which he expressed "solidarity and closeness" with her.\nHe added that he was praying for "social harmony and respect for democratic values" to prevail in his native country.\nAddressing the nation late on Thursday night, President Fernández - who worked as chief-of-staff to both Ms Fernández de Kirchner and her husband during their tenures - said: "Cristina remains alive because, for a reason not yet technically confirmed, the gun, which contained five bullets, did not fire."\nHe went on to condemn the attacker and said the attempt on Ms Fernández de Kirchner\'s life was one of the "most serious" incidents since the country returned to democracy in 1983. \n"We can disagree, we can have deep disagreements, but hate speech cannot take place because it breeds violence and there is no chance of violence coexisting with democracy," President Fernández said, declaring a national holiday on Friday to allow Argentines time to "express themselves in defence of life, democracy and in solidarity with our vice president".\nArgentina\'s economy minister, Sergio Massa, called the attempted shooting an "attempted assassination".\n"When hate and violence prevail over debate, societies are destroyed and situations like these arise: attempted assassination," he said in a tweet.\nMs Fernández de Kirchner has yet to make any comment.\nShe is accused of defrauding the state and of fraudulently awarding public works contracts in her stronghold in Patagonia while she was president between 2007 and 2015.\nIf convicted at trial, prosecutors have asked that the ex-president face 12 years in prison and a lifetime ban from politics.\nHowever, Ms Fernández de Kirchner is the Senate president and so enjoys parliamentary immunity. She would not be imprisoned unless her sentence was ratified by the country\'s Supreme Court, or she loses her Senate seat at the next elections at the end of 2023.\nMs Fernández de Kirchner has faced numerous other corruption trials following her time as president. The verdict of this trial is expected to take some months.', 'sentiment-title': -0.9978010058403015, 'sentiment-summary': -0.8505052328109741, 'sentiment-article-title': -0.996467113494873, 'sentiment-text': -0.3538138398102352, 'emotion-title': {'anger': 0.8504650592803955, 'fear': 0.14207930862903595, 'joy': 0.0029397914186120033, 'sadness': 0.0029327082447707653, 'surprise': 0.0008644565823487937, 'love': 0.0007186437142081559}, 'emotion-summary': {'fear': 0.9252310395240784, 'joy': 0.03643764555454254, 'sadness': 0.020608773455023766, 'anger': 0.010852710343897343, 'surprise': 0.005238939076662064, 'love': 0.0016309156781062484}, 'emotion-article-title': {'anger': 0.9405805468559265, 'fear': 0.05253308638930321, 'sadness': 0.0032896725460886955, 'joy': 0.0022706533782184124, 'love': 0.0007029921398498118, 'surprise': 0.0006229560822248459}, 'emotion-text': {'fear': 0.37970290654006283, 'anger': 0.4417837795834722, 'sadness': 0.040467717258642164, 'joy': 0.12483572224508473, 'surprise': 0.002195852521773694, 'love': 0.01101401788660691}}, {'section': 'top-stories', 'position': 6, 'title': 'Afro swim cap approved after Olympic ban', 'summary': 'The move is described as "a huge step in the right direction" by a specialist cap maker.', 'img': 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7', 'link': 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-62765571', 'article_title': 'Soul Cap: Afro swimming cap approved after Olympic ban', 'article_time': '2022-09-02T10:15:01.000Z', 'article_text': 'A swimming cap for afro hair has been approved for use in top-level competitions.\nThe specialised covering - designed for thick, curly hair and styles such as dreadlocks, weaves and braids - was banned from last year\'s Olympics.\nManufacturer Soul Cap described the approval from governing body Fina as "a huge step in the right direction".\n"We\'re excited to see the future of a sport that\'s becoming more inclusive," it said.\nFina executive director Brent Nowicki said the announcement "follows a period of review and discussion on cap design between Fina and Soul Cap over the past year", in a statement reported by the Metro.\n"Promoting diversity and inclusivity is at the heart of Fina\'s work, and it is very important that all aquatic athletes have access to the appropriate swimwear."\nAfro hair is naturally drier than other hair because it has fewer cell layers. The sodium hypochlorite - or bleach - found in swimming pools can dry it out more, leading to damage.\nLast year, Soul Cap said Fina had told them the hats weren\'t suitable because they didn\'t follow "the natural form of the head".\nMany swimmers criticised the comments, with some saying it would discourage black people from participating in the sport.\nYoung black swimmers told Radio 1 Newsbeat they were "disappointed and heartbroken".\nKejai Terrelonge said haircare was one of many barriers she\'s faced.\n"Using the smaller swimming caps that everyone else would use - it would fit on my head.\n"But because I put [protective] oil in my hair, when I was swimming it would just keep sliding off and my hair would get wet," said Kejai, who lives in Birmingham.\nIn response, Fina said it would review the situation and added that it understood "the importance of inclusivity and representation".\nWhite British children are over-represented in swimming relative to the wider population, according to a 2020 report by Sport England.\nAround 29.3% of white British children take part in swimming, compared with 21.9% of Asian children and 20.1% of black children.\nThe decision "sets a precedent for the sport" according to swimmer Alice Dearing, the first black woman to represent Great Britain in an Olympic swimming event.\n"Giving swimmers the option is what this is all about.

Her energy bills are not covered by the price cap, the maximum amount energy firms can charge most domestic customers, hence the quick-fire showers.\nBut why is that?\nResidents on communal heating, or heat networks, are not covered by Ofgem\'s energy price cap - because they are not buying their gas directly from one of the energy companies that Ofgem regulates. They are classed as commercial systems - despite often being within residential buildings.\nHeat networks work as a communal boiler. Hot water is pumped directly to people\'s homes from a communal source, which can often be found miles away from its final destination. Some homes have individual meters, while others do not.\nThey are often used in apartment blocks, but also in clusters of social housing. Sometimes it is managed by a third party company, but sometimes by landlords themselves. They naturally seek to pass on the costs to the tenants as wholesale gas prices rocket up -  but there is no rule on how they impose these price increases.\nRetiree Paul Bolding is already feeling the effect, even as autumn creeps in. The bills for his London home - which uses heat networks - have already risen by 350%.\nThe flat Paul owns is one of roughly 65 apartments in his development, all of which are supplied with heat from a combined heat and power plant machine in a plant room in the building, he tells BBC News.\nThe hot water from this communal heating system is then distributed across each flat, but each household has its own meter that records the heat used and bills residents.\nIn June, Paul says, prices increased from 8.2p per kWh to 36.42 per kWh (plus VAT). He presumes these prices will last a year but as it is not regulated by Ofgem, he fears there is nothing to prevent a further raise. For comparison, the price cap set by Ofgem will be 15p per kWh for gas from October. \nPaul says he is mainly frustrated by the lack of transparency and regulation to protect people from "unscrupulous operators" and ensure all energy bills are capped amid rising wholesale gas prices. \nThe lack of security of a price cap, even one that is being raised quite dramatically in the coming months, is something that Oona says she finds "very worrying" as she budgets for paying her bills.\nAs well as the short showers, she is making other small changes to her day-to-day routine, to make savings on other bills. These include switching off unnecessary lights and running her washing machine on cold water, to cut back on her electricity charges.\n"London is so expensive already," she says, "it will be hard to justify staying long-term". \nIt is not just those on the lowest incomes who are frustrated by the apparent price-cap loophole.\nOver the last couple of years, a large number of ultra-luxury developments, as well as more affordable and local authority homes, have opted to rely on it as it was seen as a government-backed - and cost-effective - solution. \nSome found that the arrangement meant they were paying less for their gas than other domestic users.\nThat is because developers who built such properties could negotiate their own, often more cost-effective, deals directly with wholesale gas suppliers.\nJust last year, the government said heat networks were "an essential technology for cutting carbon emissions in a cost-effective way while reducing bills and tackling fuel poverty".\nIt also went on to pledge £19m to boost funding and investment on heat networks across the country. \nBut on Thursday, the National Housing Federation (NHF) urged ministers to take urgent action about the situation with gas prices that has developed since.\nThe NHF\'s Kate Henderson told the BBC the majority of residents on heat networks live in social housing and an estimated 72% of those living in social housing are over 55.\nMs Henderson called for the government and energy companies to work together to find a solution to protect vulnerable residents who will not be able to afford "extortionate bills".\nSome bills are expected to jump by as much as 500% this winter, and residents have already noticed their bills rising during the warmer months, Ms Henderson said.\nThe government said it was aiming to help all people affected by higher energy bills. \nA government spokesman said: "We know people are worried about rising energy bills, which is why we have confirmed further funding equivalent to the £400 Energy Bills Support Scheme will be available for those not already covered - including a small minority of those using heat networks."\nParliament is also currently assessing a new Energy Bill, which could increase regulation for heat networks. \nThe proposed legislation would give Ofgem powers to investigate and take action when consumers on heat network agreements appear to be paying "disproportionate" amounts.\nThat is something that Stephen Knight, director at Heat Trust, is particularly keen to see. His organisation provides independent regulatory advice in the sector, and he warns that even if the government takes that action it will not help people this winter.\nHe explained any benefits of the proposed bill would not be felt by heat networks consumers for another couple of years. "In the meantime, we have this massive energy crisis where gas prices have gone through the roof."\nAccording to data from the Department for Energy, an estimated 476,951 consumers rely on heat networks for their energy source. But Mr Knight says the number of consumers is likely to be much higher, as these statistics were collated seven years ago.\nThe energy price cap, set by Ofgem every three months, applies to domestic supply agreements in England, Wales and Scotland, and will be £3,549 for a typical household from October. Businesses, including restaurants, have called for the cap to be extended to commercial supplies.\nMake Sense of Food Prices\nFind out why food prices are also on the rise.\nWatch now on BBC iPlayer (UK only).', 'sentiment-title': -0.9983481168746948, 'sentiment-summary': -0.995554506778717, 'sentiment-article-title': -0.9983481168746948, 'sentiment-text': -0.5648943044637379, 'emotion-title': {'joy': 0.6339048147201538, 'anger': 0.3050449788570404, 'sadness': 0.04861536994576454, 'fear': 0.006053620483726263, 'love': 0.0046351198107004166, 'surprise': 0.001746118301525712}, 'emotion-summary': {'fear': 0.5589115619659424, 'joy': 0.1887502521276474, 'anger': 0.1856139600276947, 'sadness': 0.05745696276426315, 'love': 0.005283975042402744, 'surprise': 0.0039833118207752705}, 'emotion-article-title': {'joy': 0.6339048147201538, 'anger': 0.3050449788570404, 'sadness': 0.04861536994576454, 'fear': 0.006053620483726263, 'love': 0.0046351198107004166, 'surprise': 0.001746118301525712}, 'emotion-text': {'love': 0.02072571129285375, 'joy': 0.4126683205510122, 'sadness': 0.05565775300400626, 'anger': 0.35793328764970955, 'surprise': 0.002339370250027921, 'fear': 0.15067556517131284}}, {'section': 'top-stories', 'position': 8, 'title': 'Queen to miss Braemar Highland games', 'summary': 'The decision was taken for the comfort of the Queen who has been suffering mobility problems.', 'img': 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7', 'link': 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-62766252', 'article_title': 'Queen to miss Braemar Highland games', 'article_time': '2022-09-02T10:32:06.000Z', 'article_text': "The Queen will miss the Braemar Gathering on Saturday, the popular Highland Games event which she attends most years.\nIt is understood the decision has been taken for the comfort of the Queen who has been suffering from mobility problems since last year.\nThe 96-year-old monarch is currently staying at Balmoral in Aberdeenshire as she does every summer.\nPrince Charles is still scheduled to attend the Braemar Games.\nHe will join spectators for the gathering which attracts crowds from the across the globe who watch competitors take part in the caber toss, hammer throw, and tug-o-war.\nIn another break from tradition, it was announced earlier this week that the Queen will appoint the new prime minister on Tuesday at her Scottish retreat for the first time in her reign.\nDuring her 70 years on the throne, the Queen has always had an audience with her new prime minister at Buckingham Palace in London.\nBut Boris Johnson, who will tender his resignation, and the new Conservative Party leader - either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak - will make the 1,000-mile round trip to Balmoral Castle instead. \nIt is understood that the decision was taken to provide certainty for the new prime minister's diary.\nThe monarch has been taking her traditional summer break in Scotland with family and guests.

tax to go up by 5p in the pound, or the standard VAT rate to go up from 20% to 25%.\nAlternatively, he said funding the increase through savings would require "significant" cuts to public services or other departments.\nOf these two options, increasing taxes was most likely, he added, given the "difficulties involved" in finding big enough savings elsewhere.\nIn contrast to spending increases on the NHS and social care, he said, there had been "very little attempt to ready the British public for the sacrifices that will be needed for a similar level of increase for defence".\nHe estimated that meeting the 3% target would likely require Ms Truss to boost troop numbers, currently due to fall to 72,500 by 2025, by 25-30%.\nThe report added that making sure the extra money is not "eaten up by increased inefficiencies" would require boosting industrial capacities. \nIt warned that more British pilots, nuclear engineers, aircraft and shipyards would be needed to ensure spending could increase enough towards the end of the decade to meet the pledge.\nHowever, it added that given the UK\'s "relatively small manufacturing sector," the government might also have to buy more equipment from abroad to meet the target on time.\nMs Truss has said she will meet her defence pledge by delivering a new fleet of submarines and more investment in cyber and space technology. \nShe has also pledged to review the size of the armed forces, and update last year\'s UK foreign policy review with a renewed focus on Russia and China.\nShe has pledged around £30bn in tax cuts if she wins power, and has ruled out introducing new taxes if she enters Downing Street.', 'sentiment-title': -0.9939232468605042, 'sentiment-summary': -0.9929764866828918, 'sentiment-article-title':

leaking into the sea.\nAuthorities said there had been a significant leak from the OS 35 on Thursday and conservationists fear major ecological damage.\nChief Minister Fabian Picardo described the next 48 hours as crucial.\nBy Friday afternoon, the British overseas territory said all the ship\'s 250 tonnes of diesel had been removed.\nThey were now starting to remove 215 tonnes of heavy fuel oil.\nThe chief minister said it was the most polluting fuel on board: "I am very concerned about a potential spill and will not be relaxed until the vessel is entirely removed."\nMarine biologist Lewis Stagnetto, from the Nautilus Project, said the smell of fuel was tangible outside the harbour on Gibraltar\'s western shoreline on Friday.\nAcross the Spanish border, north of the Rock, the mayor of La Línea de la Concepción said oil had begun to reach the town\'s beaches, but it had come from the ship\'s machinery rather than its tanks.\nNo-one was hurt when the bulk carrier collided late on Monday with the tanker Adam LNG, which was carrying liquefied natural gas. \nAlthough the OS 35 was damaged, Gibraltar authorities said the ship continued to leave the Bay of Gibraltar, heading for the Strait of Gibraltar which connects the Mediterranean with the Atlantic Ocean.\nAt that point, the captain indicated he was taking on water. Gibraltar officials said they decided to run the carrier aground, semi-submerged, to prevent it from sinking. Port authorities tried to repair the hull but it broke in two and by Wednesday some of the fuel had begun to leak into the sea from the tank\'s vents.\nThe captain is understood to have been arrested.\nAlthough the ship was beached on the east side of the Rock off Catalan Bay, conservationists said the oil had seeped around the southernmost tip of the Rock towards its western shore, on the Bay of Gibraltar.\n"Everyone\'s feeling quite shell-shocked at the moment," said Mr Stagnetto. Gibraltar\'s NGOs were looking for all types of animals that might have been affected, from limpets to seabirds such as cormorants, he added. \n"The biggest problem with oil spills is that everyone focuses on the black stuff, but this is diesel flowing out. We did see some heavy fuel in little patches but overall the fuel is diesel. As it becomes more viscous it infects all animals and pollutes the ecosystem."\nBooms have been deployed to contain the oil leak and a Spanish marine rescue crew has helped Gibraltar authorities use skimmers to recover the oil from the surface. \nThe chief minister said on Friday that the amounts of oil that had hit the shore, although regrettable, were fairly minor: "We are hopeful that a full clean-up can be achieved." \nSpanish authorities were placed on alert and patrols were sent to coastal areas to monitor possible pollution in what is called the Bay of Algeciras in Spain.', 'sentiment-title': -0.9870842099189758, 'sentiment-summary': -0.997439980506897, 'sentiment-article-title': -0.9978546500205994, 'sentiment-text': -0.630944076511595, 'emotion-title': {'fear': 0.9327964782714844, 'sadness': 0.03484718129038811, 'anger': 0.02287307381629944, 'joy': 0.00567146111279726, 'surprise': 0.0026545426808297634, 'love': 0.0011572466464713216}, 'emotion-summary': {'fear': 0.8352483510971069, 'joy': 0.06701356917619705, 'anger': 0.04950791224837303, 'sadness': 0.04198581725358963, 'surprise': 0.0037278279196470976, 'love': 0.002516502281650901}, 'emotion-article-title': {'fear': 0.9471333026885986, 'anger': 0.023614292964339256, 'sadness': 0.01778409071266651, 'joy': 0.007371238898485899, 'surprise': 0.0030416673980653286, 'love': 0.0010553798638284206}, 'emotion-text': {'fear': 0.5644698882372015, 'anger': 0.14042738961547407, 'sadness': 0.0488974209357467, 'joy': 0.18783520061859033, 'surprise': 0.05668810777974108, 'love': 0.0016819887548788553}}, {'section': 'top-stories', 'position': 12, 'title': "NI man with 'Aladdin's cave' of weapons is jailed", 'summary': 'Robert Templeton from Ballymena is sentenced to a year in prison after admitting a range of offences.', 'img': 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7', 'link': 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-62769831', 'article_title': "Robert Templeton jailed over 'Aladdin's cave' of weapons", 'article_time': '2022-09-02T13:33:32.000Z', 'article_text': 'A man who admitted having an "Aladdin\'s cave" of weapons and bomb components in his home has been jailed for a year.\nRobert James Templeton, 36, had pleaded guilty to having explosive substances and ammunition under suspicious circumstances.\nA court previously heard he was preparing for an economic breakdown.\nOn Friday he was told he will spend a further 12 months on licence and will be subject to Violent Offences Prevention for five years.\nTempleton, of Shancoole in Ballymena, County Antrim, had also pleaded guilty to attempting to convert an item into a firearm, importing a friction-lock baton, possessing a stun gun and possessing documents likely to be of use to a person "committing or preparing an act of terrorism".\nAll the offences were committed between 12 March 2015 and 5 July 2019.\nBelfast Crown Court heard that on 5 July 2019 police searched his "cluttered and dishevelled\'\' home and uncovered gunpowder, chemicals and fertilisers, fuses, fireworks, ball bearings, nuts and washers, metal pipes and tools along with ammunition and instruction manuals in how to make improvised bombs and firearms.\nOfficers also uncovered a catapult, large swords including a Samurai sword, a crossbow and bolts and a "significant quantity" of food.\nA book entitled US Army Improvised Munitions Handbook was found in the master bedroom which had a lock on the outside of the door.\nOther documents seized included one entitled The Zip Gun... the simplest of improvised firearms.\nThe prosecution described it as an "Aladdin\'s cave" of weaponry and bomb components and told Judge Patricia Smyth it was accepted that Templeton had all the materials as a result of his "compulsive purchasing for the purposes of making improvised explosive devices and there was no concerted effort by him to put those items together.
